GARLIC is a program for calling runs of homozygosity in genotype data.  It implements the ROH calling method of Pemberton et al. AJHG (2012).

**NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: In order to successfully run GARLIC you must have ann_figtree_version.dll and figtree.dll in the same folder as garlic.exe 

This ROH calling pipeline has four phases.

I.		Window-based LOD score calculation
II.		Kernel Density Estimation of LOD score distribution
III.	Assembly of ROH
IV.		Gaussian Mixture Modeling of ROH size distribution

GARLIC depends on the following libraries.

GNU GSL: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ 
FIGTree: http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~morariu/figtree/
zlib: http://zlib.net/

25OCT2016 - Update to version 1.0.1.  This update fixes a bug where ROH that extended upto the end of the chromosome failed to get assembled and reported.
This update also introduces a new command-line flag --overlap-frac which is designed to reduce false positive calls by requiring a SNP be covered by at 
least OVERLAP_FRAC (default 0.25) proportion of high scoring windows to be included in an ROH call.  This helps to reduce false positive calls near the 
boundaries of true ROH.

Garlic v1.0.1
----------Command Line Arguments----------

--auto-winsize <bool>: Initiates an ad hoc method for automatically selecting the # of SNPs in which to
	calculate LOD scores. Starts at the value specified by --winsize and increases
	by <step size> SNPs until finished.
	Default: false

--auto-winsize-step <int>: Step size for automatic window selection algorithm.
	Default: 10

--build <string>: Choose which genome build to use for centromere locations (hg18, hg19, or hg38).

	Default: none

--centromere <string>: Provide custom centromere boundaries. Format <chr> <start> <end>.

	Default: none

--error <double>: The assumed genotyping error rate.
	Default: -1.000000e+00

--freq-file <string>: A file specifying allele frequencies for
	each population for all variants. File format:
	SNP	ALLELE	<pop1 ID> <pop2 ID> ...
	<locus ID> <allele> <pop1 freq> <pop2 freq> ...
	By default, this is calculated automatically
	from the provided data.
	Default: none

--freq-only <bool>: If set, calculates a freq file from provided data and then exits.
	Default: false

--help <bool>: Prints this help dialog.
	Default: false

--kde-subsample <int>: The number of individuals to randomly sample for LOD score KDE. If there
	are fewer individuals in the population all are used.
Set <= 0 to use all individuals (may use large amounts of RAM).
	Default: 10

--lod-cutoff <double>: For LOD based ROH calling, specify a single LOD score cutoff
	above which ROH are called in all populations.  By default, this is chosen
	automatically with KDE.
	Default: -9.999990e+05

--max-gap <int>: A LOD score window is not calculated if the gap (in bps)
	between two loci is greater than this value.
	Default: 200000

--out <string>: The base name for all output files.
	Default: outfile

--overlap-frac <double>: The minimum fraction of overlapping windows above the LOD cutoff required
	to begin constructing a run.
	Default: 0.25

--raw-lod <bool>: If set, LOD scores will be output to gzip compressed files.
	Default: false

--resample <int>: Number of resamples for estimating allele frequencies.
	When set to 0 (default), garlic will use allele
	frequencies as calculated from the data.
	Default: 0

--size-bounds <double1> ... <doubleN>: Specify the short/medium and medium/long
	ROH boundaries.  By default, this is chosen automatically
	with a 3-component GMM.  Must provide 2 numbers.
	Default: -1.000000

--tfam <string>: A tfam formatted file containing population and individual IDs.
	Default: none

--tped <string>: A tped formatted file containing map and genotype information.
	Default: none

--tped-missing <char>: Single character missing data code for TPED files.
	Default: 0

--winsize <int>: The window size in # of SNPs in which to calculate LOD scores.
	Default: 10

--winsize-multi <int1> ... <intN>: Provide several window sizes (in # of SNPs) to calculate LOD scores.
	LOD score KDEs for each window size will be output for inspection.
	Default: -1
